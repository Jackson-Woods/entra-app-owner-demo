# Microsoft Entra Admin Center - App Owner Management Prototype

A functional prototype demonstrating enhanced app owner management capabilities for Microsoft Entra admin center, focusing on Enterprise applications and App registrations.

## ✨ Features

### Core Functionality
- **📋 Application Management**: View and manage Enterprise applications and App registrations
- **👥 Owner Management**: Add, edit, and remove application owners with role-based permissions

- **Full Owner**: Complete administrative control (blocked for groups)

### Advanced Validation System
- **🚫 Group + Full Owner Blocking**: Prevents groups from being assigned as Full owners with security warning
- **⚠️ Group + Technical Owner Warning**: Allows but warns when assigning groups as Technical owners
- **✅ User Assignment**: Full flexibility for user assignments in any role

3. **Advanced Validation**: Security-focused validation preventing risky group assignments
4. **Role-Based Permissions**: Granular owner type selection with appropriate warnings
5. **Improved Navigation**: Context-aware sidebar with application sub-navigation
